# forge-flow — Dev Plan

Unified skill for both **Claude Code** and **Codex** that handles the full forge-flow lifecycle:
plan creation/maintenance (`design`) and plan execution (`TDD` / `IDD`).

This project replaces the two standalone repos `claude-forge-flow-executor` and
`codex-forge-flow-executor` with a single source of truth that ships both variants
plus a shared installer.

## Milestone format

Each milestone uses 4 required sections — **Why**, **Approach**, **Tasks**,
**Done when** — and an optional **Notes** section when something doesn't fit
elsewhere. Every task is a markdown checkbox.

Closed milestones live in **[`DEVPLAN-COMPLETED.md`](DEVPLAN-COMPLETED.md)** as a compact index (`MNN | title | date | sha`); full details remain in Git history. Newly closed milestones are recorded verbatim at close-out, and compressed only with the user’s explicit approval. Numbering continues from the highest ID there.

## Deferred — Existing-project pilot

This is not an executable milestone. It requires explicit authorization, a selected
repository and a desired change. An isolated run would trace selective spec reads,
a green characterization baseline before implementation, the TDD red/green cycle and
stopping on a principle departure without an approved exception. Controlled scenarios
in M85 do not close this real-project validation gap.
